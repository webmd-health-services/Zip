SUMMARY
    Publishes a Node module package to the target NPM registry

    
DESCRIPTION
    The `PublishNodeModule` task runs `npm publish` in the current working directory.

    This task will install the latest LTS version of Node into a `.node` directory (in the same directory as your whiskey.yml file). To use a specific version, set the `engines.node` property in your package.json file to the version you want. (See https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines for more information.)


PROPERTIES
    
    * `NpmRegistryUri` (**mandatory**): the URI to the registry where the module should be published.
    * `CredentialID` (**mandatory**): the credential to use when publishing. Credentials are added to your build with the `Add-WhiskeyCredential` function. This `CredentialID` property should be the same value as the `ID` parameter used when adding the credential with `Add-WhiskeyCredential`.
    * `EmailAddress` (**mandatory**): the email address to use when publishing.


EXAMPLES    

    ## Example 1
    
        Build:
    	- PublishNodeModule

    Demonstrates how to publish the Node module located in the same directory as your whiskey.yml file
    
    ## Example 2
    
    	Build:
	    - PublishNodeModule:
    	    WorkingDirectory: 'app'

    Demonstrates how to publish a Node module that isn't in the same directory as your whiskey.yml file. In this example, the Node moule in the `app` directory is published (`app` is resolved relative to your whiskey.yml file).
