SUMMARY
    Deletes files or directories.


DESCRIPTION
    The `Delete` task deletes files or directories. If the file/directory doesn't exist, nothing happens.

    This task also deletes files when a build is cleaning.


PROPERTIES

    * `Path` (**mandatory**): a list of paths to delete. Must be relative to the `whiskey.yml` file. Paths that don't exist are ignored. Wildcards are allowed.


EXAMPLES

    ## Example 1

    Build:
    - Delete:
        Path:
        - result.json
        - .output\*.upack
    
    This example demonstrates how to use the `Delete` task to delete files. In this case, the `result.json` and all `.upack` files in the `.output` directory are removed.

    ## Example 2

    Build:
    - Delete:
        Path:
        - Test\bin
        - Test\obj
    
    This example demonstrates how to use the `Delete` task to delete directories. In this case, the `Test\bin` and `Test\obj` directories will be deleted.
