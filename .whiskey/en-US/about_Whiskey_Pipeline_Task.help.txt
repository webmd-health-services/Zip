SUMMARY
    Runs the tasks in a Whiskey pipeline.


DESCRIPTION
    The `Pipeline` task runs pipelines defined in your `whiskey.yml` file. Pipelines are properties that contain a list of tasks. You are required to have a default `Build` pipeline. Other pipelines exist side-by-side with your `Build` pipeline, e.g.

        Build:
        - Pipeline:
            Name: BuildASpecificThing

        BuildASpecificThing:
        - MSBuild:
            Path: SpecificThing.sln

    In this example, the default `Build` pipeline runs the `BuildASpecificThing` pipeline. 

    Use the `Pipeline` task if you want the ability to run parts of your builds in isolation, e.g. if you have multiple applications to build, you can declare a dedicated pipeline for each. Your default build runs them all, but you can run a specific pipeline by passing that pipeline's name to the `Invoke-WhiskeyBuild` function.


PROPERTIES

    * `Name`: a list of pipelines to run. Pipelines are run in the order declared.


EXAMPLES

    ## Example 1

        Build:
        - Pipeline:
            Name: BuildASpecificThing

        BuildASpecificThing:
        - MSBuild:
            Path SpecificThing.sln
            
    This example declares two pipelines: `Build` and `BuildASpecificThing`. The `Build` pipeline runs the `BuildASpecificThing` pipeline.           


    ## Example 2

        Build:
        - Pipeline:
            Name: 
            - BuildASpecificThing
            - BuildAnotherThing

        BuildASpecificThing:
        - MSBuild:
            Path SpecificThing.sln
            
        BuildAnotherThing:
        - MSBuild:
            Path BuildAnotherThing.sln
            
    This example demonstrates how to run multiple pipelines with the `Pipeline` task. In this example, the `BuildASpecificTing` tasks will run, followed by the `BuildAnotherThing` tasks.
